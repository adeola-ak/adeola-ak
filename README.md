# hey there, I'm Adeola!

I'm a recent Software Engineering bootcamp graduate who truely found a love for programming in 3 short months. 

I love programming because it's mine. It's personal, it's creative, it's an outlet and it's a challenge. I'm passionate about technology
and all there is to learn about it because there is so much to learn and so much to do. I'm definetely a "Doer".

I am passionate about connecting, learning and mastery. Anything worth doing is worth doing (beyond) well. I'm also passionate
about impact. I love helping people, making people smile, and I love creating a change.


#### fun fact: Learning React made me want to cry ðŸ˜… I learned a valuable lesson though because I LOVE React now. 
### LESSON LEARNED? I can learn anything!
