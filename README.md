### Hi there 

I'm Adeola Akinsiku. I'm a recent Software Engineering bootcamp grad. Who has barely gone a day without coding since I started ðŸ˜¬


I love coding because it's mine. It's personal, it's creative, it's an outlet and it's a challenge. I'm passionate about technology
and all there is to learn about it because THERE IS SO MUCH TO LEARN :) 


What else am I passionate about? I'm passionate about mastery. Anything worth doing is worth doing (beyond) WELL. And I'm also passionate
about impact. I love helping people, I love making people smile, I love creating a change.


I've never been as anxious in life as I am now. I want to learn Java & PHP. I want to build a blog and write articles, I want to freelance, 
I want to network and build cool things with people new to tech that I don't know, I want to learn mobile development, I want to learn more about 
cloud services, I want to help build brands and companies. I want to land my âœ¨FIRST DEV JOBâœ¨... WOAH! But I'm making it work by prioritizing and 
doing a little bit of everything I can daily.

### LATEST PROJECT: 
Mock E Commerce that I decided to do to learn Redux due to the large amount of state needed for e-commerce builds, as well as get some experience with
Google Firestore. 

What's left to do: Implementing Graphql, Styles & Animations
