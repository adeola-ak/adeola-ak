# Hi There, I'm Adeola!

I'm a recent Software Engineering bootcamp graduate who has barely gone a day without programming since I started ðŸ˜¬


I love coding because it's mine. It's personal, it's creative, it's an outlet and it's a challenge. I'm passionate about technology
and all there is to learn about it because THERE IS SO MUCH TO LEARN and so much to DO. I'm definetely a "Doer".


What else am I passionate about? I'm passionate about learning and mastery. Anything worth doing is worth doing (beyond) WELL. I'm also passionate
about impact. I love helping people, I love making people smile, I love creating a change. I like being memorable.


I've never been as anxious in life as I am now. There is just so much that needs to get done. I want to learn Java & PHP. I want to build a blog and 
write articles, I want to freelance, I want to network and build cool things with people also new to tech that I don't know, I want to learn mobile 
development, I want to learn more about cloud services, I want to help build brands and companies. I want to land my âœ¨FIRST DEV JOBâœ¨... WOAH! 
But I'm making it work by prioritizing and doing a little bit of everything that I can daily.

### currently: 
1. familiarizing myself with the basics of computer science with Harvard's CS50: Intro To Computer Science online course
2. working on a photography website for a client
3. learning how to build a gatsby blog
4. learning java

### latest project: 
Mock E Commerce Site that I decided to build to learn Redux due to the large amount of state needed for e-commerce builds, as well as get some experience with
Google Firestore. 

What's left to do: Implementing Graphql, Styles & Animations
